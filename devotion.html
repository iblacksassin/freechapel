                    <h2>God Gets The Final Say</h2>
                    <p>“You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done...” Genesis 50:20
                        Satan may know your weak spots, but the good news is God can still use them for your good. In Genesis 50:20, 
                        Joseph said, “What you meant for my evil, 
                        God turned for good.” The enemy comes to deflate your life, but Jesus comes to fill it.

                    <h2>God’s Will To Fill</h2>
                    <p>“The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.” John 10:10
                        In 2015, New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady celebrated with his team after defeating the Indianapolis Colts 45 to 7. 
                        They were headed to the Super Bowl, and everyone fully expected the media to buzz about the two teams that had made it- the Seahawks and the Patriots. 
                        But news broke later that afternoon that the footballs used by the Patriots had been deflated.

                    <h2>3 Encounters On The Way To Your Dream</h2>
                    <p>“A man’s gift makes room for him And brings him before great men.” Proverbs 18:16 
                        Before Joseph could see his dreams come true, he had to have three encounters. 
                        In the same way, you must encounter three types of people who will act as catalysts to your vision.
                         First, Joseph encountered a “butler.” A butler opens the doors. 
                         There are places you can’t get to on your own, but God has “butler” people who will open doors for you.
