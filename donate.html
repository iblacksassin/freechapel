                <p>Today to help with Hurricane Disaster Relief
     
    
                    Your gift can make a world of difference.
                     
                    
                    Our hearts and prayers continue to be with those affected by Hurricane Helene. After making landfall as a Category 4 Hurricane, the storm continued its path of devastation for over 600 miles across 6 states. It has become the deadliest storm to strike the US in more than 2 decades. 
                    
                    In response to this unprecedented disaster, we are partnering with God's Pit Crew and Red Truck Men, along with others on the ground to provide essential supplies like generators, food, water, hygiene items, first aid kits, and more to those in greatest need.
                    
                    If you would like to make a difference, we are sending a truck with God's Pit Crew with 288 generators, totaling $97,920. Each generator costs $340. In addition, we are sending 2,200 Blessing Buckets, filled with essential items, to the hardest-hit areas. The total for these buckets is $77,000, with each costing $35.
                    
                    In addition, we’re now partnering with Red Truck Men who are coordinating volunteers to serve on the ground in the hardest hit areas. These men are driving in to offer direct assistance, distributing supplies and providing over 100,000 hot meals to those in need.
                    
                    We believe this is just the beginning of what we can do in response to this ongoing crisis. Recovery in many areas will take weeks and months if not longer. Keep these families in your prayers! Your financial donations make these vital services possible, enabling us to bring hope to those in need.
